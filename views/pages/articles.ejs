    <text>At house of science we pride ourselves in taking in people from schools that don't have robotics teams. These kids are not supported by their schools in there search for robots domination however they are emotionally supported by their schools. These kids under the guidance of shane and paul are train to be the very best at making VEX robots.</text>
